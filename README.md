MathEngine
==========

My math engine to compute derivatives and apply functions composed of +, -, *, /, ^, ln, sin, cos, etc.

This project is written entirely in Java. It does not currently support reading functions from text - they must be constructed through the API. I plan to use ANTLR to support reading functions from text.
